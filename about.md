Hi, there! I'm Arthur Alves.
I live in The Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±, originally from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

I could describe myself as Mobile and macOS Engineer with a strong passion for automation, tooling, open source, FRP and other cool stuff you hear nowadays. This space is especially for my projects and software development.

Besides coding I do love football âš½, video games ðŸŽ® and many other things, so follow me on social media if you'd like to connect.

## Open Source

I've always wanted to be more active in the open source community, but you know, the old `"I don't have time for it right now"` excuse kept me away for too long. Not anymore! Be sure you follow me on [Github](https://github.com/arthurpalves) ðŸš€

## Gaming Industry

I'm venturing myself in game development, slowly but surely building a story driven RPG for console.
It will take years. Check that work on [Redslash](https://www.redslash.co).

## What I do for a living?

Currently Mobile Tech Lead at this super cool fintech, ðŸ‘‰ [Backbase](https://www.backbase.com)
